# Horse Race Simulator

This project is a Horse Race Simulator that allows users to simulate and analyze horse races. It consists of two parts: Part 1 and Part 2.

## Part 1

In Part 1, we will focus on building the basic functionality of the Horse Race Simulator. This includes:

- Creating a Horse class to represent individual horses.
- Implementing a Race class to manage the race and simulate the race progress.

So far I have 10 horses to the race, feel free to add as many as you want. To run the file just go to RaceTest.java and then either press run or F5 and you will begin the race.

## Part 2

In Part 2, we will enhance the Horse Race Simulator by adding additional features and improvements. Some of the planned enhancements include:

- Implementing different type of tracks with features the user can choose from.
- Implementing different types of horses with features the user can choose from.
- Introducing betting functionality, allowing users to place bets on horses.
- Adding buttons to start the race, see horse metrics and previous horses metrics.

There is a main method in the RaceGUI class, just press F5 and it will run.
